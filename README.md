# -Fine-Tuning-OpenAI-LLM

In this project I tested how to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model using the OpenAI API in Python. 

## Case Study 
You are an AI engineer, a telecommunications company that provides internet, television, and phone services. This company operates with a large customer base and manages a substantial volume of daily inquiries, support requests, and product reviews. The company has received numerous complaints from customers, expressing dissatisfaction. Their objective is to enhance customer satisfaction by analyzing customer complaints more regularly to address and fix issues regarding their services. They require a Large Language model capable of extracting specific details from each complaint, including the topic, problem, and customer dissatisfaction index in real-time. This dissatisfaction index will range between 0 and 100, representing the level of customer anger derived from the complaint text. the Company has provided a dataset containing the latest 50 user complaints along with the extracted information in the desired format. Your role as an AI engineer is to use the OpenAI API and Python to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model and retrain a new large language model (LLM) that is capable of extracting the necessary information from a given customer complaint in the desired format.
